# Learning resources

The official documentation for the original hardware versions of the modules is the best place to get in-depth information about how they work.

   * [ansible](https://monome.org/docs/ansible/)
   * [teletype](https://monome.org/docs/teletype/) + [manual](https://monome.org/docs/teletype/manual) + [command cheatsheet](https://monome.org/docs/teletype/TT_commands_4.0.pdf) + [teletype studies](https://monome.org/docs/teletype/studies-1/)
   * [earthsea](https://monome.org/docs/earthsea/)
   * [meadowphysics](https://monome.org/docs/meadowphysics/)
   * [white whale](https://monome.org/docs/whitewhale/)

See the "Further reading" and "Tutorial videos" sections for each module for additional learning material.

# Communities of practice

[//////// aka Lines](https://llllllll.co) is a nice place to discuss music making and music making tools and making tools for music. There is a [Lines thread on this plugin](https://llllllll.co/t/monome-vcv-rack-ports-development-log/10337). Some excellent and relevant lines threads include:

   * [a user's guide to the wonderful world of teletype](https://llllllll.co/t/a-users-guide-to-the-wonderful-world-of-teletype/35971)
   * [how do you use your ansible?](https://llllllll.co/t/how-do-you-use-your-ansible/46846/)
   * [kria strategies](https://llllllll.co/t/kria-strategies/17671)

Check out the recordings of past [flash crash livecoding events](https://flashcrash.net/) for examples of teletype in live performance.
