The original hardware and firmware projects were initiated by [@tehn](https://github.com/tehn) at [monome](https://monome.org) with contributions from many members of the [lines community](https://llllllll.co). See the [individual submodule repositories](https://github.com/Dewb/monome-rack/tree/main/firmware) for more details. The VCVRack-specific code is a separate community effort, and again, no support or warranty is implied.

[Michael Dewberry](http://dewb.org) ([@dewb](https://github.com/Dewb)) wrote the virtual grid module, the hardware simulation layer, and the VCV module wrapper for white whale, meadowphysics, earthsea, and teletype.
