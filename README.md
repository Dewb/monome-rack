monome-rack â€” VCVRack plugin for monome hardware
---

### What is this?

This is a plugin for the [VCVRack open-source virtual modular synthesizer](https://github.com/VCVRack/Rack) that implements (some of) the Eurorack modules and control hardware manufactured by [monome](https://monome.org). This is an unofficial community-driven port and no support, warranty, or affiliation is implied.

This is a work-in-progress. [Here's the roadmap to get to a binary release on the package manager.](https://github.com/Dewb/monome-rack/projects/1) If you're not using the source version of VCV Rack, and you're not comfortable with git and make, you might want to wait until the binary release.

This plugin currently includes:
* A virtual version of the venerable [grid 128](https://monome.org/docs/grid/), an open, interactive 16x8 grid instrument
* The [white whale](https://monome.org/docs/modular/whitewhale/) "Grid-enabled Probabilistic Step Sequencer"
   * A 16-step sequencer with a focus on live-manipulation and controlled variations
   * 4 trigger outs, 2 CV outs
   * Controlled by internal or external clock
* The [meadowphysics](https://monome.org/docs/modular/meadowphysics/) "Grid-enabled Rhizomatic Cascading Counter"
   * An event sequencer for polyrhythms and rule-based evolving patterns.
   * 8 trigger outs
   * Controlled by internal or external clock
* The [earthsea](https://monome.org/docs/modular/earthsea/) "Grid-enabled Shape-Memory Pattern Instrument"
   * A live keyboard that can sequence melodies and recall CV with gestures.
   * 1 trigger out, 4 CV outs
   
All three of the modules can connect to either a virtual grid or a real hardware grid controller through [serialosc](https://monome.org/docs/setup/).

### How do I use this?

For now, this is a *source-only plugin*, no binary package is provided. *You must also build VCVRack from source before you can compile plugins* -- this will not work with the downloadable version of VCVRack.

This plugin has been built and tested on the following platforms:
* Mac OS X 10.12.6
* Windows 10 (with Msys2)
* Ubuntu 16.04

Instructions:

* Clone [VCVRack](https://github.com/VCVRack/Rack) and follow its build instructions for your platform. Build the master branch, not 0.5.0.
* Clone this repo into the `plugins` folder under VCVRack.
* Change into the `monome-rack` folder and clone submodules with `git submodule update --init --recursive`
* Build with `make`, or open the `monome-rack` folder in Visual Studio Code and select `Tasks > Run Build Task`.

Now that you've built the plugin, let's get to patching:

* Start VCVRack. Add a `white whale` and `grid 128` module to your patch.
* Right-click the `white whale` module and select your virtual grid from the list of devices. It should light up.
* Read the manuals for the modules:
   * [white whale manual](https://monome.org/docs/modular/whitewhale/)
   * [meadowphysics manual](https://monome.org/docs/modular/meadowphysics/)
   * [earthsea manual](https://monome.org/docs/modular/earthsea/)
* Watch these videos:
   * [white whale possibilities](https://vimeo.com/104881064)
   * [white whale tutorial part 1](https://vimeo.com/105368808)
   * [white whale tutorial part 2](https://vimeo.com/105368874)
   * [white whale tutorial part 3](https://vimeo.com/105408057)
   * [white whale tutorial part 4](https://vimeo.com/105408747)
   * [meadowphysics possibilities](https://vimeo.com/107582557)
   * [meadowphysics tutorial](https://vimeo.com/107586549)
   * [meadowphysics two](https://vimeo.com/146731772)
   * [earthsea introduction](https://vimeo.com/113231441)
* Read the manuals again, watch the videos again, repeat.

### Why is this?

In order of importance, the initial goals of this project were/are:

* Provide an easier environment for developing, debugging, and testing new and improved firmware features for the monome Eurorack modules
* Allow existing hardware users to practice, experiment, and/or record while traveling light
* Expose new users to the monome hardware/software ecosystem
* Accelerate development of completely new grid applications
* "Because it was there"

### How does this work?

The firmware for the monome modules are written in C for the AVR32 platform. (For more details, [go here](https://github.com/monome/libavr32).) In this project, these firmware projects are built into separate C shared libraries together with stub I/O implementations for parts of the AVR32 API. The Rack plugin will load a new copy of this firmware library into memory for each module that you load, so statics and globals work as expected within each module instance.

### Who did this?

Original hardware and firmware code in linked submodules is by [monome](monome.org) with contributions from the community at [lines](https://llllllll.co). The VCVRack-specific code in this repository is a separate effort, and again, no support or warranty is implied.

[Michael Dewberry](http://dewb.org) ([@dewb](https://github.com/Dewb)) wrote the virtual grid module, the hardware simulation layer, and the VCV module wrapper for white whale.
