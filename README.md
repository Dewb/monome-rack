monome-rack â€” VCVRack plugin for monome hardware
---

### What is this?

This is a *PRERELEASE* plugin for the [VCVRack open-source virtual modular synthesizer](https://github.com/VCVRack/Rack) that implements (some of) the Eurorack modules and control hardware manufactured by [monome](https://monome.org). This is an unofficial community-driven port, and no support guarantees, warranty, or affiliation is implied from any organization mentioned in this document.

This plugin is still in development. [The release roadmap is here](../../projects/1). If you're not comfortable with testing prerelease software, you might want to consider waiting for plugin to appear on the package manager.

This plugin currently includes:
* Virtual versions of the venerable [monome grid 64 and 128](https://monome.org/docs/grid/), a series of open, interactive grid instruments, in 8x8 and 16x8 versions.
* The [white whale](https://monome.org/docs/modular/whitewhale/) grid-enabled probabilistic step sequencer
   * A 16-step sequencer with a focus on live-manipulation and controlled variations
   * 4 trigger outs, 2 CV outs
   * Controlled by internal or external clock
* The [meadowphysics](https://monome.org/docs/modular/meadowphysics/) grid-enabled rhizomatic cascading counter
   * An event sequencer for polyrhythms and rule-based evolving patterns
   * 8 trigger outs
   * Controlled by internal or external clock
* The [earthsea](https://monome.org/docs/modular/earthsea/) grid-enabled shape-memory pattern instrument
   * A live keyboard that can sequence melodies and recall CV with gestures
   * 1 trigger out, 4 CV outs
   
All three of the modules can connect to either a virtual grid or a real hardware grid controller. ([Serialosc](https://monome.org/docs/setup/) is required to use real hardware, but no drivers are required for the virtual grids.) 

Through the virtual grid, all features of each module are accessible, but some features are awkward to use without multiple fingers on a real grid. Control-clicking (Linux/Windows) or Command-clicking (Mac OS) will allow you to "hold" keys to perform multi-press gestures.

### How do I use this?

The `master` branch is now compatible with Rack 1.0. For Rack 0.6.2, check the `v0.6` branch.

We now have experimental CI builds on the [Releases page](../../releases). These builds are built against the prerelease Rack SDK version `1.dev.439b3f6`.

This plugin has been built and tested on the following platforms, though [bugs and issues](/../../issues) still exist.
* Mac OS X 10.13
* Windows 10
* Ubuntu 16.04 

#### To build with the Rack SDK:

* Clone this repo.
   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/Dewb/monome-rack
   ```
* Change into the `monome-rack` folder and clone the plugin's submodules with `git submodule update --init --recursive`
   ```bash
   $ cd monome-rack
   $ git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```
* Download the Rack SDK.
   ```bash
   $ curl -O https://vcvrack.com/downloads/Rack-SDK-1.1.6.zip
   $ unzip Rack-SDK-1.1.6.zip
   ```
* Build with `make`.
   ```bash
   $ RACK_DIR=$(PWD)/Rack-SDK make
   ```

#### To build with the complete VCV Rack source:

* Read the [VCVRack](https://github.com/VCVRack/Rack) build instructions for your platform and follow them carefully. Build the `v1` branch. Run and test Rack to make sure it works as expected.
   ```bash
   $ git clone -b v1 https://github.com/VCVRack/Rack
   $ cd Rack
   $ git submodule update --init --recursive
   $ make dep
   $ make
   $ make run
   ``` 
* Clone this repo into the `plugins` folder under VCVRack.
   ```bash
   $ cd plugins
   $ git clone https://github.com/Dewb/monome-rack
   ```
* Change into the `monome-rack` folder and clone the plugin's submodules with `git submodule update --init --recursive`
   ```bash
   $ cd monome-rack
   $ git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```
* Build with `make`, or open the `monome-rack` folder in Visual Studio Code and select `Tasks > Run Build Task`.
   ```bash
   $ RACK_DIR=$(PWD)/../.. make
   ```
Now that you've built the plugin, let's get to patching:

* Start VCVRack. Add a `white whale` and `grid 128` module to your patch.
* Right-click the `white whale` module and select your virtual grid from the list of devices. It should light up.
* Read the manuals for the modules:
   * [white whale manual](https://monome.org/docs/modular/whitewhale/)
   * [meadowphysics manual](https://monome.org/docs/modular/meadowphysics/)
   * [earthsea manual](https://monome.org/docs/modular/earthsea/)
* Watch these videos:
   * [white whale possibilities](https://vimeo.com/104881064)
   * [white whale tutorial part 1](https://vimeo.com/105368808)
   * [white whale tutorial part 2](https://vimeo.com/105368874)
   * [white whale tutorial part 3](https://vimeo.com/105408057)
   * [white whale tutorial part 4](https://vimeo.com/105408747)
   * [meadowphysics possibilities](https://vimeo.com/107582557)
   * [meadowphysics tutorial](https://vimeo.com/107586549)
   * [meadowphysics two](https://vimeo.com/146731772)
   * [earthsea introduction](https://vimeo.com/113231441)
* Read the manuals again, watch the videos again, repeat.

### Why is this?

In order of importance, the initial goals of this project were/are:

* Provide an easier environment for developing, debugging, and testing new and improved firmware features for the monome Eurorack modules
* Allow existing hardware users to practice, experiment, and/or record while traveling light
* Expose new users to the monome hardware/software ecosystem
* Accelerate development of completely new grid applications
* "Because it was there"

### How does this work?

The firmware for the monome modules are written in C for the AVR32 platform. ([More details here](https://github.com/monome/libavr32).) In this project, these firmware repos are built into separate C shared libraries, together with stub I/O implementations for parts of the AVR32 API. The Rack plugin will load a new copy of this firmware library into memory for each module that you load, so statics and globals work as expected within each module instance.

### Who did this?

Original hardware and firmware code in linked submodules is by [monome](monome.org) with contributions from the community at [lines](https://llllllll.co). The VCVRack-specific code in this repository is a separate effort, and again, no support or warranty is implied.

[Michael Dewberry](http://dewb.org) ([@dewb](https://github.com/Dewb)) wrote the virtual grid module, the hardware simulation layer, and the VCV module wrapper for white whale, meadowphysics, and earthsea.

Additional community contributions and feedback are very welcome! Discuss either in an [issue here](/../../issues) or in the [lines thread](https://llllllll.co/t/white-whale-in-vcvrack/10337).
