monome-rack â€” VCVRack plugin for monome hardware
---

### What is this?

This is a work-in-progress repo for a plugin package for the [VCVRack open-source virtual modular synthesizer](https://github.com/VCVRack/Rack) that implements (some of) the Eurorack modules and control hardware manufactured by [monome](https://monome.org). This is an unofficial community-driven port and no support, warranty, or affiliation is implied.

This plugin includes:
* A virtual version of the venerable [grid 128](https://monome.org/docs/grid/), a flexible 16x8 grid controller
* The [white whale](https://monome.org/docs/modular/whitewhale/) grid-enabled probabilistic step sequencer
   * Uses either a virtual grid, or a real grid connected via serialosc

### Why is this?

In order of importance, the initial goals of this project were/are:

* Provide an easier environment for developing, debugging, and testing new and improved firmware features for the monome Eurorack modules
* Allow existing hardware users to practice, experiment, and/or record while traveling light
* Expose new users to the monome philosophy and ecosystem
* "Because it was there"

### How does this work?

The firmware for the monome modules are written in C for the AVR32 platform. (For more details, [go here](https://github.com/monome/libavr32).) In this project, these firmware projects are built into separate C shared libraries together with stub I/O implementations for parts of the AVR32 API. The Rack plugin will load a new copy of this firmware library into memory for each module that you load, so statics and globals work as expected within each module instance.

### How do I use this?

For now, this is a *source-only plugin*, no binary package is provided. *You must also build VCVRack from source before you can compile plugins* -- the downloadable version will not work.

This plugin has been built and tested on the following platforms:
* Mac OS X 10.12.6
* Windows 10 (with Msys2)
* Ubuntu 16.04

Instructions:

* Clone [VCVRack](https://github.com/VCVRack/Rack) 0.5.0 or later and follow its build instructions for your platform.
* Clone this repo into the `plugins` folder under VCVRack.
* Change into the `monome-rack` folder and clone submodules with `git submodule update --init --recursive`
* Build with `make`, or open the `monome-rack` folder in Visual Studio Code and select `Tasks > Run Build Task`.

Now that you've built the plugin, let's get to patching:

* Start VCVRack. Add a `white whale` and `grid 128` module to your patch.
* Right-click the `white whale` module and select your virtual grid from the list of devices. It should light up.
* Read the [white whale manual](https://monome.org/docs/modular/whitewhale/).
* Watch these videos:
   * [white whale possibilities](https://vimeo.com/104881064)
   * [white whale tutorial](https://vimeo.com/105368808)
* Read the [white whale manual](https://monome.org/docs/modular/whitewhale/) again.

### Who did this?

Original hardware and firmware code in linked submodules is by [monome](monome.org) with contributions from the community at [lines](https://llllllll.co) The VCVRack-specific code in this repository is a separate effort, and again, no support or warranty is implied.

[Michael Dewberry](http://dewb.org) ([@dewb](https://github.com/Dewb)) wrote the virtual grid module, the hardware simulation layer, and the VCV module wrapper for white whale.

Additional community contributions and feedback are very welcome! Discuss either in an [issue here](/../../issues) or in the [lines thread](https://llllllll.co/t/white-whale-in-vcvrack/10337).
