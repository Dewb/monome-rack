# simple-svg
Easy to use SVG library for C++ (fork)

This library is a single file header-only C++ library for creating SVG files.

Simple-SVG was written to provide an easy API to allow beginners to become more accustomed to C++ by easily creating graphics.

This project creates files that can then be viewed by a sister project [File Monitor](http://code.google.com/p/file-monitor). As you make changes to your SVG document, you will automatically see an updated image in File Monitor.


This is a fork/clone of the original code [here](https://code.google.com/p/simple-svg/).
